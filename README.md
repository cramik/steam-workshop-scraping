# steam-workshop-scraping
scrapes steam workshop item names incrementally (with a speed limit of one request every 5 seconds), might later add functionality to scrape screenshots/artwork and then maybe workshop content itself

this probably is mean to do to steam and will eventually get you throttled, im guessing
