# steam-workshop-scraping
scrapes steam workshop item names incrementally (with a speed limit of one request every 5 seconds), might later add functionality to scrape screenshots/artwork and then maybe workshop content itself

this is probably mean to steam servers and will probably get you throttled eventually
